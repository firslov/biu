* biu
This is a magic tool used in shell and based on python.
** Installation
Clone files:
#+begin_src 
pip install git+https://github.com/firslov/biu
#+end_src
It looks up for python recipes in the =~/.biu.d= directory. 
Here is an example recipe

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def clean():
    return [
        'rm *.pyc',
        'rm *~',
        'rm -rf __pycache__'
    ]
#+END_SRC
Suppose it is saved as =~/.biu.d/dir.py=, one can call it with
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
biu dir clean
#+END_SRC
Enjoy!
